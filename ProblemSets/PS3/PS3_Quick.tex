2. How many lines did the CSV file have before doing the end-of-line (EOL) con- version? (see 3(g)) Answer: My output says "0", which is obviously not correct though i am not sure how to fix it. (update: figured it out)

3. How many lines did the CSV file have after doing the EOL conversion? (see 3(j)) Answer: 36,634
