\section{Question 5}
There are observations with 450 variables

\section{Question 6}
Optimal Lambda was found to be lambda = 0.0435 | 
The in sample RMSE was = 0.2041295 | 
The out of sample RMSE = 0.1842767

\section{Question 7}
The new optimal value of lambda = 0.0976 | 
In sample = 0.1645316 | 
Out of sample = 0.1424507 | 

\section{Question 8}
The new optimal value of lambda = 0.0137 | 
In sample = 0.1672074 | 
Out of sample = 0.1461131 | 
Of all options, I would choose the LASSO model for this example.

\section{Question 9}
You would not be able to use a simple linear regression because the data is clearly not uniformly linear at any point - e.i there are too many variables that need to be categorized. Considering the above analysis, I would say low variance and high bias.
