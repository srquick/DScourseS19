\section{Data Interests}
I would be interested in scraping data from one of two sources to match my interests. The first would be from FRED, the St. Fed's database to track the price of WTI and Brent crude oil and compare those to see how related they are to other macro-economic factors. The second would be scraping data that included OU football stats to analyze some of that data to see if we could find the factors that best predict a national championship.

\section{Questions in 6}
-6-4: class df1 is a data frame.
      class df is a Spark Data Frame.

-6-5: Running the "select" function for df1 yielded an error message dealing with finding the  "select" function, I believe.

-6-5: The same error occurred. Probably from trying to use a non-sparkR dataframe
