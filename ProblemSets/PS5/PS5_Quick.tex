\section{Analysis One}
This data consists of only the Vcard information from the Wikipedia page of Karl Lagerfeld, the famed fashion designer who recently passed away. I realize that this seems to be a pretty pathetic attempt at web scraping, but this was the only website where I had limited success scraping. The only upside to this is that I was able to scrape the data all by myself.
This data does not particularly interest me, though I can imagine a situation where I was attempting to collect the information of famous people and this type of web-scraping would be useful. However, I doubt that this particular data would ever be of use to me.

\section{Analysis Two - API}
For the API section I found that people use the word "energy" to discuss many different topics. My intention was to test the sentiment of individuals in the 50 miles around the OU campus pertaining to the energy industry. Perhaps a proper noun would have yielded more pointed results, as many of the tweets came back to personal energy and what people describe as "big dick energy".
